# IRSec2019

The Incident Response Security Competition is our more beginner-friendly Red/Blue competition.
IRSeC is typically hosted in the late spring at RIT.
With IRSeC, we aim to provide RIT students with some initial defensive and incident response experience.
IRSeC also features an entirely student-run Red Team comprised of RITSEC members.
